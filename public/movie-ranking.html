<h2>Movies I enjoyed</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</h3>
<p>This movie is amazing. It's a fantastic film about a young guy that has to fight the evil ex boyfriends of the girl he loves with a twist, the world acts like a videogame and it's fantastic.</p>
<h3>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</h3>
<p>This is the second Godzilla movie of the new franchise released by Warner Bros. and, in my opinion, the best one of the (so far) thrillogy. I'm a fan of giant monster movies so this one is a must watch for me.</p>
<h3>Pacific Rim</h3>
<p>Same as the last one, Pacific Rim scratches my need for big monsters fighting each other and this one isn't the exception. The film is about humanity having to build giant robots to fight Kaiju's that started coming from a rift in the bottom of the pacific ocean, basically monsters from another dimention. A very good movie for sure.</p>
<h3>Avatar the Way of Water</h3>
<p>Even though this movie has a very simple story, it has the BEST CGI I've ever seen in my life. The experience of watching this film in a big screen is unforgettable and I highly recommend experiencing it... beautiful.</p>
